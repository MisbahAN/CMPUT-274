# CMPUT 274 - Introduction to Tangible Computing I

## Course Overview
CMPUT 274 is a part of a two-sequence intensive introduction to Computing Science. In this course, students will learn key concepts of procedural programming, basic algorithm design, and analysis through practical problem-solving using Python. Development is conducted in a Linux operating system environment.

## Assignments
This repository will include the following assignments:
1. **Assignment 1: Introduction to Python Basics**  
   In this assignment, students will be introduced to the fundamentals of Python programming. The focus will be on variables, data types, control structures, and basic input/output operations. Students will complete a series of exercises designed to solidify their understanding of Python syntax and programming logic.

2. **Assignment 2: Advanced Python Concepts and Data Structures**  
   In this assignment, students delve deeper into Python by exploring more complex concepts such as recursion and data structures. The tasks include implementing a recursive function to generate permutations, simulating stack behavior using a queue, and solving coding challenges involving expression evaluation and Unix path simplification. These exercises are designed to enhance problem-solving skills and strengthen the understanding of Python's advanced features and algorithms.

3. **Assignment 3: Priority Queues and Binary Search Trees**  
   This assignment covers concepts related to priority queues and binary search trees (BST). Students will implement and manipulate data structures like priority queues using stacks and perform various operations on BSTs, such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. These tasks are designed to deepen students' understanding of tree-based data structures and their applications.

4. **Assignment 4: Sorting Algorithms and Analysis**  
   In this assignment, students will implement and analyze various sorting algorithms such as quicksort and mergesort. The focus will be on understanding the performance and efficiency of different sorting techniques. Additionally, students will complete a series of exercises that require them to apply sorting algorithms to solve real-world problems and optimize performance.

5. **Assignment 5: Coin Change Problem**  
   This assignment involves solving the coin change problem, where students are tasked with determining the minimum number of coins required to make a specific sum using a given set of denominations. Students will implement dynamic programming solutions to efficiently solve the problem and handle edge cases where a solution may not exist.

## Usage
To run the assignments, ensure you have Python installed on your Linux environment. Follow the instructions within each assignment's directory for specific requirements and execution steps.
